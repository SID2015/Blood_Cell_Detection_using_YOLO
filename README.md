# Blood_Cell_Detection_using_YOLO

We will be working on a healthcare related dataset and the aim here is to solve a Blood Cell Detection problem.
Our task is to detect all the Red Blood Cells (RBCs), White Blood Cells (WBCs), and Platelets in each image 

# NOTE : 
 I have also included .py file similar to jupyter notebook file just in case the notebook doesn't open in github.


# Setting up the System Requirements

The below libraries are required to run this project:

pandas
matplotlib
tensorflow
keras – 2.0.3
numpy
opencv-python
sklearn
h5py
 
There are 6 columns in the train file. Let’s understand what each column represents:

image_names: contains the name of the image
cell_type: denotes the type of the cell
xmin: x-coordinate of the bottom left part of the image
xmax: x-coordinate of the top right part of the image
ymin: y-coordinate of the bottom left part of the image
ymax: y-coordinate of the top right part of the image
